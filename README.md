## üé≠ Managing Personalities

### Easy Prompt Editing

Personality prompts are stored in separate text files for easy editing:

- **Configuration**: `personalities.json` - Contains metadata and references to prompt files
- **Prompts**: `prompts/` directory - Contains the actual system prompts as plain text files

### Adding a New Personality

1. **Create a prompt file:**
   ```bash
   # Create your prompt file
   echo "Your system prompt here..." > prompts/my_personality.txt
   ```

2. **Add to personalities.json:**
   ```json
   {
     "my_personality": {
       "name": "My Personality",
       "description": "Description of the personality",
       "emoji": "üé™",
       "prompt_file": "prompts/my_personality.txt"
     }
   }
   ```

### Editing Existing Prompts

Simply edit the text files in the `prompts/` directory:

```bash
# Edit any personality prompt
nano prompts/debate_bro.txt
nano prompts/debate_baby.txt
nano prompts/triggered_lib.txt
```

No need to escape quotes or deal with JSON formatting!

### Current Personality Files

- `prompts/debate_bro.txt` - Aggressive logical destroyer
- `prompts/debate_sis.txt` - Cute but ruthless anime girl
- `prompts/debate_baby.txt` - Innocent toddler with devastating questions  
- `prompts/triggered_lib.txt` - Hyper-progressive academic with moral superiority

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

### Prompt Loading System

The bot supports two ways to define system prompts:

1. **External Files** (recommended):
   ```json
   {
     "personality_key": {
       "name": "Name",
       "description": "Description", 
       "emoji": "üéØ",
       "prompt_file": "prompts/file.txt"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Inline** (legacy):
   ```json
   {
     "personality_key": {
       "name": "Name",
       "description": "Description",
       "emoji": "üéØ", 
       "system_prompt": "Your prompt here..."
     }
   }
   ```

The system automatically detects which format you're using and loads accordingly.

## üí° Usage Tips

### Effective Debating

- **Be Specific**: All personalities challenge vague claims - define your terms clearly
- **Expect Pushback**: Each bot assumes you're wrong and will find flaws in unique ways
- **Try Different Personalities**: Each offers a completely different debate experience
- **Stay Engaged**: Short, focused responses work best for rapid back-and-forth
- **Watch the Thinking**: Enable thinking mode to see how the bot analyzes your arguments

### Personality Differences

- **Debate Bro**: Hits you with pure logic and facts, no mercy
- **Debate Sis**: Destroys you with cuteness while being devastatingly logical
- **Debate Baby**: Makes you feel dumb through innocent toddler questions
- **Triggered Lib**: Attacks through moral superiority and academic credentials

### Customizing Behavior

Edit any personality file in `prompts/` to adjust:
- Tone and aggressiveness
- Response length preferences  
- Focus areas (logic, evidence, definitions)
- Debate style (Socratic, adversarial, etc.)

## üîß Development

The project uses:
- **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview** for AI responses with thinking
- **Streamlit** for the web interface with personality selector
- **asyncio** for streaming responses
- **Simple file-based configuration** for easy personality management
